CMake Warning (dev) at /usr/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.cmake:438 (message):
  The package name passed to `find_package_handle_standard_args` (rt) does
  not match the name of the calling package (RT).  This can lead to problems
  in calling code that expects `find_package` result variables (e.g.,
  `_FOUND`) to follow a certain pattern.
Call Stack (most recent call first):
  build-arm-ubuntu-release/pigpio-src/cmake/FindRT.cmake:28 (FIND_PACKAGE_HANDLE_STANDARD_ARGS)
  build-arm-ubuntu-release/pigpio-src/CMakeLists.txt:8 (find_package)
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.
